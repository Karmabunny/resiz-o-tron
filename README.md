# resiz-o-tron
This is a simple image resizer tool for Windows written in C#.

It is designed to solve a problem we are having with our clients - images taken with modern
digital cameras are too large, taking forever to upload and using a lot of ram when doing a server-side
image resize for web use.

This tool allows for esy bulk residing of images prior to upload into the CMS; although it can be used for other
purposes too.


## Supported operating systems

The resiz-o-tron has been tested with:
- Windows XP
- Windows Vista
- Windows 7
- Windows 8.1

It also works correctly under Wine and has been tested on Linux.

# resiz-o-tron-5000
This is a simple image resizer tool for Windows written in C#.

It is designed to solve a problem we are having wiith our clients - images taken with modern
digital cameras are too large, taking forever to upload and using a lot of ram when doing a server-side
image resize for web use.

This tool allows for esy bulk residing of images prior to upload into the CMS; although it can be used for other
purposes too.
